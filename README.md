# Weighted_Hybrid_Technique_for_Recommender_Systems
## Project Overview
This project implements a weighted hybrid technique for recommender systems, combining various recommendation algorithms to improve prediction accuracy and user satisfaction. The approach leverages multiple data sources and recommendation strategies, integrating them in a way that weights their outputs based on their relevance and effectiveness.

## Features
- **Hybrid Recommendation Model:** Combines collaborative filtering, content-based filtering, and other relevant methods into a single recommendation model.
- **Weight Customization:** Allows for adjustable weights to alter the influence of each component in the final recommendation.
- **Performance Metrics:** Includes evaluation metrics to assess the accuracy and efficiency of the recommendations.

## Requirements
To run this notebook, you will need:
- Python 3.6 or higher
- Libraries: pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn

## Installation
Clone this repository to your local machine:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Apoorva-Udupa/Weighted_Hybrid_Technique_for_Recommender_Systems.git
